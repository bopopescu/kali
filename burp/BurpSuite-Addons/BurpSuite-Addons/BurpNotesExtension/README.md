##INTRODUCTION 

Burp Notes Extension is a plugin for Burp Suite that adds a Notes tab. The tool
aims to better organize external files that are created during penetration
testing.

Features:
- Create text documents and spreadsheets directly within the Burp
interface
- Send HTTP requests and responses directly to new or existing files

##REQUIREMENTS 

- Burp Suite Pro 1.5.0.1+
- OpenCSV (if building from source) - http://opencsv.sourceforge.net

##BUILDING FROM SOURCE 

1. Drop Burp Suite Pro and the latest OpenCSV JARs in ./lib
2. ant clean; ant compile; ant jar;

##USAGE 

1. In Burp Suite navigate to the Extender tab.
2. Select "Add".
3. Leave Extension Type as "Java" and choose "Select fileâ€¦".
4. Navigate to the included "BurpNotesExtension.jar" file or your JAR compiled
from source, then click "Open".
5. Click "Next" to load the plugin.

Within the Notes tab, you can:
- Save Notes: Save any currently open documents to a file.
- Load Notes: Load a previously saved set of notes from a file.
- New Text: Add a tab with a new text document.
- Import Text: Load the contents of a text document.
- New Spreadsheet: Add a tab with a new spreadsheet.
- Import Spreadsheet: Load the contents of a CSV document. 
- You can also export individual notes tabs to an external file. 

From other tabs in Burp, right clicking in areas where a user can normally
interact with HTTP Responses and Requests, such as the Proxy History or Site Map
Table, will present options to send those items directly to the Notes Tab,
either in a new document or appended to an existing one.
