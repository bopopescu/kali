* Multiple values per id

* Generalize extension from recognition of user ids to object ids
   (e.g. documents, downloads etc.). User should be able to define
   multiple object groups. The active scanner module only exchanges
   the found id by ids from the same group.

* Case insensitive match of identifiers and values as option

* RegExp matches of identifiers and values

* Add blacklist of URLs for login requets
   In login requests it is intended to submit an user id. No issue
   should be reported in these cases.

* Disable detection for particular parameter types
   Some web applications store session data client-side, e.g. in
   cookies, and transmit the user name in such requests. In such cases
   the extensions is quite useless in current state because it would
   report all requests.

* Add some heuristics to identify typical parameter names
   There are parameter names like uid, userId etc. which are typical
   suspicious to vulnerailities targeted by this extension.

* Detection and automatic addition of user ids
   User identifiers and possibly values could be automatically
   recognized by usage of heuristics and suggested to the user for
   addition into the list.
