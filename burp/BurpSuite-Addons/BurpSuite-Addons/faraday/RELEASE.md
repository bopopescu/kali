Notifications: Updating objets on faraday now results in a beautiful
notification in the QT ui.

Performance: Enhacing performance when lots of workspaces are available.
We now load each workspace whe it's needed instead of loading ahead the
full workspace list.

UI: Workspace split, now you can select the workspace to visualize. We
are now using bootstrap.

API: New operations on the Rest API (this is just for the following UI
modifications). Vulnerability update and delete operations.

We are proud to present two new features that will enhace the Faraday experience.
Taking feedback from our users we took account that each of them had particular needs from their consoles (completion, size, fonts, so on so forth)  and their need to be able to know what commands where run during an engagement.

    * A brand new ZSH based Terminal UI
    * The Command Run execution history
